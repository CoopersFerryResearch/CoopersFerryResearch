        <h1>Chapter 4 - Archeological Field School</h1>
        <blockquote>
        <p>At Cooper’s Ferry the goal is to find everything in the ground exactly as it was placed, as much as possible. Using trowels, wooden skewers, and brushes, archaeologists remove sediment from around objects of a certain size. Anything that is dime-sized or larger is kept in the ground, drawn, and mapped with a Total Station. Once the object, it’s location in space, and its material has been documented, the artifact is ready to be removed and put into an appropriate container to be observed later. At the screening station archaeologists send buckets of sediment through two different sized metal screens to find any small artifacts they might have missed. These artifacts are sorted by type of material and put into small plastic bags to be examined later.</p>
        <p>A field school is an outdoor classroom where students directly apply their knowledge of archaeology techniques from class and experience a live excavation site first hand. In order to be fully certified as an archaeologist, archaeology students must have completed at least one field school to earn their degree. Cooper’s Ferry is one of the most advanced field schools in the United States in regards to diversity of subject matter, use of progressive technology, and groundbreaking evidence of early American archaeology.</p>
        <p>The Cooper’s Ferry field school is led by Dr. Loren Davis and focuses mostly on the environment in the Lower Salmon River Canyon and how it relates to the formation and preservation of sites such as the one found at Cooper’s Ferry. Students study the geologic processes of erosion and sedimentation to gather clues as to how the Cooper’s Ferry site was formed, but also to gain an idea of how other sites would have been formed. Dr. Davis uses the environment around him to demonstrate to students how wind, water, geologic formations and man made changes to the landscape have changed the way the Salmon River evolved over time.</p>
        <p>The field camp is located just three minutes away from the excavation site, on a piece of ranch land commonly referred to as “Bug slope”. For the most part, the students are provided with the basic amenities of home. The students are given propane powered stoves and fridges, along with pantries to store food. The kitchen tent is used as the common area, and students use this as a general hangout place to eat, play games and socialize.</p>
        <p>The typical work day at Cooper’s Ferry lasts from 8am to 3pm. After the excavation is done, students are free to do a wide variety of different activities, including swimming in the river, or heading back to the local town for a bite to eat. The field camp is home for approximately 20-25 students and staff every year. Typically people bring board games, sports equipment or books to pass the time.</p>
        <p>The site is open to Undergraduates and Graduate students and caters to different skill levels. The site is even open to non-archaeology students, those looking to volunteer, or just looking to try something new. During the course of the field school these students learn about Pacific Northwest Archaeology, Early American Archaeology, Geology, Anthropology and attempt to synthesize these ideas and techniques into a hybrid way of looking at archaeology sites all over the world. Students of all ages have come to participate. Some think of it as a “summer camp for adults”.</p>
        <p>The Cooper’s Ferry staff is comprised of graduate students or students who were personally asked to return to the site. These students oversee and manage parts of the excavation site to form a sort of hierarchy at the site. This organizational structure allows for students to help other students and allow the site director to focus on research projects. Some staff members have been working at the Cooper’s Ferry site for several seasons, and have chosen an aspect of the site to focus on and research for their Graduate Thesis project.</p>
