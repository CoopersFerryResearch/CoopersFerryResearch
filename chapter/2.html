    <h1>Chapter 2 - History</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <h3>1930: How was Cooper's Ferry created?</h3>
                <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>During the early 20th Century, the Cooper’s Ferry Locality as we know it today would have been indistinguishable from the surrounding canyon landscape: steep, sloping hills cascaded into the rushing Salmon River.</p>
                <p>In the 1930’s, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Idaho state officials noticed that the naturally occurring	 passage from the Idaho plains to the canyon depths was the perfect spot for the new “Highway 99”, which would cut across Idaho’s landscape to connect neighboring towns.</p>
                <p>For several years, bulldozers, trucks and dynamite blasted away at the slopes of the canyon; creating a flat surface-- enough to lay a road across. Soon thereafter however, the United States entered into World War II, and funding to the project was cut before the highway could be properly finished.</p>
            <h3>1960: B. Robert Butler</h3>
                <p>The Cooper’s Ferry site would almost never have been found if it weren’t for the curiosity of one man.
                    In the early 1960s, a professor, B. Robert Butler of University of Idaho, was passing through the town of Cottonwood, Idaho when he noticed strange artifacts he had never seen before. These artifacts were on display in a local grocery store.</p> 
                <p>When he asked the shop owner where they had found the “arrowheads”, the locals showed him a small terrace near the river where they had been gathering sand for their gardens. This was the same terrace that the WPA had cleared nearly 30 years before to make way for the road.Intrigued by what he found after an initial look at the site, Butler began excavating the site the following summer. Using backhoes, spades and hours upon hours of man hours, B. Robert Butler and his team found many artifacts that looked completely different to those seen anywhere else in the United States.</p>
                <p>In addition to finding artifacts, Butler was convinced that these artifacts proved that the people who made them were among the first people to ever live in North America.</p>

            <h3>1997: Dr. Loren Davis</h3>
            <p>Years later, Loren Davis, then working on his Master’s Thesis for his dissertation, took an interest in Butler’s research. By matching old photos, gathering testimonies from local residents, and with support from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Dr. Davis made an educated guess at where he believed the old site to be, and in 1997, dug a “test pit” to see if there was any more evidence of early peoples at the location. At 3 meters deep (9 feet) Dr. Davis’ discovered a ‘weapon's cache’ made up of several stone tools that, under analysis, showed evidence of use at some point.</p> 
            <p>This was enough evidence to prove that the Cooper’s Ferry site should be investigated further. Dr. Davis gained support from Oregon State University and The Bureau of Land Management and began excavating the site in full in 2007.</p>
